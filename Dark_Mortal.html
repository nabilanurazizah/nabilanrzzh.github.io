			<div>After being serialized in Naver Best Challenge Comics, it was promoted to an official webtoon and serialized every Sunday from December 16, 2018 on <a href="https://comic.naver.com/webtoon/list?titleId=718021" target="blank">Naver Webtoon</a></div><br>
			<div>It was completed with a total of 81 episodes on July 12, 2020.</div><br> 
			<div>The writer said that he would make it for free for 1 year, and after 1 year and 1 month, it was paid in August 2021. However, readers praised the decision of the writer, saying that they would rather pay more to see it.</div>

				<b class="mark">4. Characteristics</b>
			</div>
		</h2><hr>
		<p>
			<div>
				The story is slightly different from the best challenge webtoon.
				<br><br>
				The writer's words are not missing in every episode, as if the writer pays great attention to communication with the readers. Readers are also responding positively, asking if there are any other writers besides this writer who can communicate with the author's words.
				<br><br>
				Unusually, there are many people whose real names are not revealed in the work. In particular, in the case of Professor Jang Ji-woong's subordinates, they do not even have nicknames in the work, let alone their real names, so most of them are called Jang Ji-woong's (Professor Jang's) subordinates, scar-green hair-blue hair.

				Likes and dislikes vary considerably. The development of the work goes smoothly, the action scenes are excellent, and the number of rice cakes is not bad, so it is evaluated as a considerable masterpiece. In addition, while advocating cool and refreshing winding and punishing evil, sadness and catharsis are properly harmonized on the other side.
				<br><br>
				However, there are some critics from some quarters. The overall character and story development is very flat and monotonous, and the distribution of weight among the characters is also unstable. In particular, although Lee Da-hyun is a character closely related to the villain side, he does not play any role, let alone participate in the main story. There are many evaluations that the drawing is also unstable.
